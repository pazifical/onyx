# Onyx

A self hosted note taking application heavily inspired by Obsidian

## Why not just use Obsidian?

There are two main reasons that inspired **Onyx**:

1. Self hosting something like Obsidian that is easy to backup
2. Running server side actions (like reminders) that push to Telegram or Discord.
