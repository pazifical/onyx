Something something

A link to [Something Deep.md](/Top%20Level%201/Deep/Something%20Deep.md)

## Code

This even has code like `python3 -m http.server` or something longer:

```
def plus_one(number: int) -> int:
    return number + 1
```

### Styling

How about _Something Italic_, **Something Bold** or so **_both of it_** using the \* character in Markdown.

### Something else nested

In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my french

Or something along those lines.

## Lists are useful

### So how about one

- First item
    - Second level
    - Also second level
        - Something on the third level
- Second item
- Third item

### Or with numbers

1. Whatever
2. However

### Checkboxes are even better

- [x] Important thing to do
- [ ] Less important thing to do
