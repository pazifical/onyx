# Server setup

Like many self hosted solutions, **Onyx** is **docker compose** ready. The official image of **Onyx** can be downloaded from Docker Hub.

## Set up Docker

On the [official Docker Website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) you can find the instructions on how to install the current **Docker** version.

## Optional: Set up Tailscale

If you have never heard about [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), you will be in for a treat. It makes it **easy and secure** to access your server via a **wireguard vpn tunnel**. And it gets better: You can easily create a **mesh vpn network**! And even better: It's **free** for personal use.

To get started using **Tailscale**, I recommend the YouTube Video [How to get started with Tailscale in under 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPdvyR7bLqI) by the great [Alex Kretzschmar](https://alex.ktz.me/). If you're interested in self hosting, his nickname **ironicbadger** should ring a bell.
