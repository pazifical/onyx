# Onyx - What is it?

**Onyx** is a self hosted note taking web application. Deploy it on a server of your choice and take notes wherever you are on whatever device you have at hand. 

There is no need for a database, because everything is stored in **markdown** files within a **directory tree** of your choosing.

## Yet another note taking solution?

Yes, another one. Why? Several reasons:

### 1. Inspiration

**Onyx** is inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is an incredible piece of software. I'd recommend anyone to at least try it, if you want something that *just works* on any device.

### 2. Shortcomings

For my use case, Obsidian has some shortcoming that cannot be overcome: you cannot self host it. Therefore something like **server actions** - like reminders via a text message - are impossible to implement.

### 3. Scratching my own itch

Like many open source projects, **Onyx** is born out of the intrinsic motivation to solve a problem at hand.
